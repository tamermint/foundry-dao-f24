## Foundry DAO

Follow along with Pat Collins's Cyfrin Updraft DAO governance course

** Changes if any, will be recorded here **

### Objectives

1. Build a contract controlled by a DAO
2. Every transaction will need to be voted on
3. Utilizing the ERC20 model for voting (although this is a bad model)
